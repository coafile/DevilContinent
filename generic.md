 The wind was as normal as it could. This was the world’s best, a never forget me like sunset. No one was aware that in front of their house a new special personality was going to be born in the St. Stonewell Hospital, it was me. Just a little cutesy child. My dad, Ronald Flinn was a carpenter and my mom Lily Flinn was a teacher in the world’s worst school named Catterival. It was a normal day on which I was born in front of my uncle’s house in the northern part of Miami. It was 18/09/1843 and 6:23:36 was the exact time.
